Bank Account QR Code Generator

This project is a simple Python script that takes a user's bank account information and generates a QR code based on that information. The generated QR code can then be used for payment purposes.

The script is designed specifically for people in Nepal and India, where QR code-based payment systems are becoming increasingly popular. By using this script, users can easily create their own QR code-based payment system for their bank accounts.
